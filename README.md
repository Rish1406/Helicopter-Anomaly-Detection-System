# 🚁 Helicopter Anomaly Detection System  

### ⚙️ Overview  
The **Helicopter Anomaly Detection System** is a next-generation AI-powered solution designed to replace the traditional **Helicopter In-Flight Monitoring System (HIMS)**.  

While HIMS focused mainly on logging and threshold-based alerting, this system brings **machine learning and predictive analytics** to helicopter monitoring — allowing for smarter fault detection, reduced false alarms, and early warnings before failure occurs.

## ❌ Limitations of HIMS  
The traditional **Helicopter In-Flight Monitoring System (HIMS)** has been a vital tool for flight data tracking, but it suffers from several key limitations:

1. **Reactive nature:** It detects faults only after they occur rather than predicting them.  
2. **Threshold-based alerts:** Uses static limits for parameters, leading to many false positives or missed detections.  
3. **Limited data utilization:** Fails to learn from historical flight data to identify complex patterns.  
4. **Manual analysis:** Engineers often need to manually review logs to confirm issues.  
5. **No real-time intelligence:** Lacks integration with AI/ML models for smart anomaly detection.

## ✅ Advantages of the Proposed System  
The **Helicopter Anomaly Detection System (HADS)** overcomes these drawbacks with a data-driven, intelligent approach:

- 🧠 **Machine Learning–Based Detection:** Learns normal flight behavior and identifies anomalies dynamically.  
- ⏱️ **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously processes live sensor data during flight.  
- 📈 **Predictive Maintenance:** Detects potential issues early, preventing costly breakdowns.  
- 🪶 **Reduced False Alarms:** Adaptive models reduce noise from minor sensor fluctuations.  
- 🖥️ **Visualization Dashboard:** Real-time and post-flight visual analysis of system health.  
- ⚙️ **Scalable & Modular:** Easily extendable to more sensors, parameters, or helicopter types.

## 🚀 How It Works  

1. **Data Collection** – Flight sensors capture telemetry data (altitude, velocity, rotor speed, etc.).  
2. **Preprocessing** – The data is cleaned and normalized to remove noise.  
3. **Model Training** – The anomaly detection model is trained using normal flight data.  
4. **Anomaly Detection** – Real-time data is compared against the model to detect unusual patterns.  
5. **Alert Generation** – If anomalies are detected, alerts are generated with severity levels.  
6. **Post-Flight Analysis** – Engineers can review stored data for fault diagnostics and maintenance planning.

## 🧪 Example Models  

- **Isolation Forest:** Detects outliers by measuring data isolation.  
- **Autoencoder (Deep Learning):** Learns normal flight patterns and flags deviations.  
- **LSTM (Sequential Model):** Captures time-series dependencies to detect time-based anomalies.
